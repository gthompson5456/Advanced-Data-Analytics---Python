    "\n",
    "Your submission will be tested with the code tester. It is important to follow these instructions to ensure your work tests properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not change the content of the cells under __SETUP__ and __TESTS__\n",
    "- Work only in the __YOUR WORK__ area\n",
    "- Rename the notebook with your group at the end (subsitute XX with your group number).\n",
    "- Assign the results of each numbered question to the appropriate test variable. For example, the answer of `1.` should be assigned to `test_1`\n",
    "- Rounding: use the supplied function `hround` to round decimal numbers when instructed. It's important to use this function because there are [multiple ways to round numbers in Python](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/programming/python-rounding-numbers) and they may not result in the same value that the tester is testing against.\n",
    "- Ensure your run the cells under __SETUP__ before you run your work\n",
    "- Before you submit your work, ensure you clean up your notebook. Your notebook has to run without an error in order to be tested. The easiest way to ensure is to `Kernel->Restart & Run All`\n",
    "- Answers are provided in along with this notebook in eLC (look a picture named `solution_key`) for your convenience\n",
    "- You will need to write a program to calculate the answers. Setting the answers to be their correct values without solving them is considered *hardcoding* and will result in zero grade for the assignment as well as a potential academic honesty violation.\n",
    "- You can also test your submission using [the online code tester](https://notebook-tester.safadi-puzzler.com/)\n"

      "It is a distinct feature of the Glaswegian spirit that we always look first at tackling inequalities and ensuring that our least well off communities are at the heart of all our thinking. I want our city to be a fairer, more just place where resilience grows from strong communities.\n",
      "This strategy has been informed by an intensive and innovative process of community engagement. Our resilience conversation has linked to more than 3,500 local residents across all age groups and communities to ensure that this strategy\n",
      "draws on a diverse range of voices. I want our people and the institutions which\n",
      "serve them to continue the conversation.\n",
      "Glaswegians love to debate and dispute and that is the foundation of a strong city democracy. We are also a friendly, neighbourly and tolerant people and these features too are the very basis of our resilient city. That's why we can face an uncertain future with confidence.\n",
      "Glasgow was proudly named as one of the first members of 100 Resilient\n",
      "Cities - pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) - in December 2013. Our membership of the network represents a major step towards creating a strategic, multi-disciplinary approach to proactively managing the\n",
      "shocks and stresses the city may face.\n",
      "This strategy is a roadmap towards greater resilience. It focuses on the continued transformation of Glasgow. Our ambition is for fair economic growth and a stronger city. We have become aware from our citywide discussions that resilience emerges from a range of inputs. This Strategy has a key role itself in helping to connect\n",
      "those inputs and to ensure our city considers resilience as an explicit and intended product of our work.\n",
      "Whilst the strategy vision is directed to the long-term future, the actions detailed in it have an initial two year timeframe for delivery. Thereafter, this action plan will be subject to a refresh ensuring that a clear focus on action is maintained and a continuing dialogue with residents is created.\n",
      "Our Resilient Glasgow Strategy has been shaped through engagement with the people of Glasgow including residents, businesses, voluntary organisations and public sector partners.\n",
      "As Chief Resilience Officer, I will continue to work with city partners and communities to develop strong collaborative capacity to push forward the delivery and implementation of this Strategy.\n",
      "I give special thanks to all of our partners for their hard work and dedication in making this Strategy possible. My gratitude extends to the team at 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) for their energy and commitment and the 100RC Strategy Partner Arup for their instrumental guidance and support.\n",
      "Above all, my thanks go out to you, the people of Glasgow for sharing your aspirations and ideas for a stronger and more resilient future. Your confidence and enthusiasm has been an inspiration to me throughout this process.\n",

      "First and foremost, this would not have happened without the vision and passion of Council Leader Cllr.

      "Glasgow's rich history, architecture, and culture are a testament to its resilience. The city has met many of the challenges of transitioning from an industrial to post-industrial city with innovation and creativity. During their resilience strategy process, the “Glasgow Game” showcased an extraordinarily robust and diverse approach to engaging stakeholders around a variety of future scenarios that are relevant for Glasgow. This is crucial. Today's challenges may not be the same tomorrow. Building lasting urban resilience requires recognizing the interplay of a city's strengths, weaknesses, shocks, and stresses. It is about bolstering the foundation of a city so that it can respond to new, unforeseen events. It is also about making decisions under circumstances where institutional and individual financial resources are limited.\n",

      "OUR RESILIENCE STRATEGY\n",
      "This Resilience Strategy is the main output of our work with 100RC to date, and the starting point for a holistic programme of resilience action. Development of the Strategy has been led by Glasgow City Council and partners, however, it belongs to the City of Glasgow and we hope that you will all play a part in moving us collectively towards a more resilient future. This Strategy has emerged from an extensive programme of work including research and analysis of the actions already underway throughout the city that contribute to resilience. This has been considered alongside in-depth consultation with Glaswegians and advice\n",
      "provided by expert stakeholders through regular Steering Group and Working Group\n",
      "meetings. This approach has given us the opportunity to identify where there may be gaps\n",
      "in our existing approach and opportunities to build on the great work we are already doing. Our membership of a global network of cities has given us the opportunity to think about our future and how we can plan ahead with a global approach. Whilst adaptation to climate change remains a principal focus of Glasgow's approach, this peer network allows us to\n",
      "share experience about the challenges of planning for a variety of chronic stresses and\n",
      "acute shocks in urban life. As a result, the scope of our Resilience Strategy has broadened.\n",
      "The future is always uncertain, but there are things we can do now and actions we can set in motion which can help us to be more resilient in the face of the challenges which that future will undoubtedly bring. This Strategy commits us to addressing challenges proactively,\n",
      "starting today.\n",
      "Our Resilient Glasgow Strategy is structured around four ‘strategic pillars' and fifteen ‘goals', which set out the long-term trajectory for Glasgow's resilience. Within this, we have identified forty-nine actions that will be implemented during the next two years. After this time, our action plan will be reviewed and refreshed.\n",
      "Glasgow has an extraordinarily rich history characterised by unshakeable strength and\n",
      "continuous reinvention in the face of shocks and stresses. We can learn the lessons of our city's past to teach us how we can make a better future.\n",
      "Glasgow is an incredibly old site of human settlement. The remains of canoes from Stone\n",
      "Age times have been found, for example, by the banks of the Clyde. In one of our main\n",
      "parks an Iron Age camp has been excavated. And in the churchyard of Govan Old there is\n",
      "evidence of Christian burials dating back to the 5th Century, indicating that it is one of the\n",
      "very earliest places of Christian worship in Scotland.\n",

      "2015 we commemorated the 250th anniversary of James Watt conceiving of the separate\n",
      "condenser to the steam engine as he walked on Glasgow Green. This was perhaps the\n",
      "single most significant act in powering the Industrial Revolution. The ripples from Glasgow's transformation lapped the shores of the whole world: Glasgow made history on a grand scale. By the late 19th century Glasgow was an industrial powerhouse known as the Second\n",
      "City of the British Empire. It built a quarter of all locomotives in use anywhere in the world and a similar proportion of global shipping. Many of the city's architectural masterpieces, such as the City Chambers on George Square, date back to this period of economic\n",
      "prestige.\n",
      "Yet it is in the last two centuries that Glasgow has seen more change than in all its long\n",
      "previous history. It was one of the first cities in the world to experience the profound\n",
      "shocks of modernity as the Industrial Revolution led to its rapid expansion and a swelling\n",
      "population. Life expectancy for Glaswegians in the 1850s was just over 25 years.\n",
      "The city entered the 20th century as one of the most densely populated in Europe, with\n",
      "a population peaking at 1.1 million. 200,000 of its citizens served in the First World War,\n",
      "with many thousands being killed or returning to Glasgow with physical and psychological injuries.\n",
      "The city played a major role in the Second World War too. However, Glasgow experienced the twin shocks of very rapid de-industrialisation and population loss in the years that followed. Traditional industries were lost and unemployment rose.\n",
      "By the late 1940s and early 1950s, many families moved out of the crowded city to live in\n",
      "nearby new towns. Those who were left were often housed in groups of high rise flats that\n",
      "quickly lost their initial attraction and became associated with urban blight and crime. The\n",
      "city's population dramatically reduced to half its previous level by the 1990s.\n",
      "As a result, Glasgow's people have experienced chronic levels of stress which have\n",
      "produced profound disparities in income, health and opportunity. The most recent profile of our population's wellbeing shows the extent of the impact of the chronic stresses. Glasgow continues to have the poorest life expectancy in Scotland for both men and women, rich and poor. These are some of the issues to which our resilience strategy is very much directed.\n",
      "For some cities, a narrative of managed economic decline would have ensued from such\n",
      "stress. Not for Glasgow. The city took steps to diversify its economy and build a more\n",
      "attractive place for families. At the centre of this approach were the city's world class\n",
      "museums and galleries, together with one of the most vibrant artistic and cultural sectors\n",
      "anywhere in Europe. Glasgow has highlighted its architectural assets, promoted its sporting credentials, and drawn on its strong further and higher education sector. Above all, the city has always regarded its communities as its most important asset and in 2013 adopted a new brand to reflect this: People Make Glasgow.\n",
      "The city's economy has developed and changed, from a carbon-intensive manufacturing\n",
      "base in the 19th century to a modern city focused on a low-carbon future. Population loss\n",
      "has been halted and the city's population is now expected to grow by 15% by 2037. This is in no small part due to Glasgow being an attractive place in which people choose to make their lives. As a result, Glasgow is the most ethnically diverse city in Scotland.\n",
      "The city was tested once again in the recession brought about by the financial collapses of 2007/08, which it has weathered with significantly lower losses in production and economic activity than in previous downturns.\n",
      "In 2014, the city was the proud host of the Commonwealth Games and, along with other major events that year, Glasgow was seen on television by one third of the entire world population.\n",
      "During our conversations with Glaswegians on what makes Glasgow a resilient city we found\n",
      "that they like to talk of their ‘bounceback-ability' factor - an ability to cope and even thrive\n",
      "through hard times. Our history of resilience and transformation is testament to that. This is why People Make Glasgow Resilient.\n",
      "As the biggest city in Scotland, Glasgow is the economic engine and main commercial\n",
      "hub not only for the region but the country as a whole. With almost half of population of\n",
      "the entire country entire living within an hour of the city, the resilience of our institutions,\n",

By aligning our strategic pillars to this policy context, we ensure the Resilience Strategy is integrated into an existing framework and adds value to the city. The following diagram visualises the relationship between Glasgow's strategic objectives and our four pillars of resilience.\n",
      "STRATEGIC PILLARS OF RESILIENCE\n",
      "The objectives of a broad range of city wide strategies, initiatives and actions are crucial for the development of our urban resilience. Our strategic pillars and indeed the city vision, have been designed to pull existing initiatives together so that these work together in a whole-systems approach.\n",
      "The image below shows some of the partnerships and strategies that have been recognised as playing a crucial role on our journey to greater resilience. These were identified by our\n",
      "city partners during early preliminary resilience assessment activity. It is by no means an\n",
      "exhaustive list.\n",
      "By working with our city partners, we will take a whole-systems approach that embeds longterm resilience thinking into existing national, regional and local strategies and initiatives. This will reinforce structural connections and delivery mechanisms between this strategy and the initiatives being delivered elsewhere in the city, meaning that our overall approach to resilience building activity is strengthened. This will also help us to monitor and track the delivery of this strategy.\n",
      "This is an agile strategy. The actions contained within this document are short-term and have been developed as iterative interventions that will help us to connect existing strategies and initiatives through the application of a resilience lens.\n",
      "These actions will be refreshed again in 2018 to ensure the strategy remains current in a city that is constantly transforming. All of our goals and actions are summarised in the strategy action plan. Some feature goals and actions are explained in full here in this strategy\n",
      "Glasgow's strategic context is sophisticated and well developed. Partners are generally agreed that the city has a good reputation and state of preparedness for dealing with sudden shocks, managed through the city's long-standing Resilience Unit and our emergency services. The city maintains a risk register for its key assets and regularly engages in emergency planning exercises.\n",
      "Attention has therefore focused on the chronic stresses over long time periods\n",
      "to which the city and its people have been subject - in particular those relating to poverty and inequality - and how best to address these over the coming\n",
      "decades. Once we started this conversation and talked more with our partners\n",
      "about resilience it became clear that these are the issues which are regarded\n",
      "locally as really significant challenges and have naturally emerged as the\n",
      "foundation of our strategy.\n",
      "By further considering how potential shocks and stresses could impact on our\n",

      "The engagement process consisted of the following:\n",
      "• Face-to-face conversations - These took place through the use of interactive techniques which included street games, participative art and public installations. The Resilient Glasgow team visited 15 locations over 25 days, speaking with over 1,500 people. People expressed their views by drawing and writing messages on blackboards and telling their stories to officers from the Resilient Glasgow team. Over 500 responses were received.\n",
      "• Targeted workshops - 12 workshops were held with nine stakeholder groups, including the Glasgow Disability Alliance; West of Scotland Racial Equality Council; Interfaith Glasgow; Glasgow Homelessness Network and the City Mission. Workshops were facilitated using an exercise called ‘The Glasgow Game', which uses role play to explore the complexities of resilience through different future scenarios. Over 300 participants attended.\n",
      "• On-line survey - Over 100 members of the public responded to a detailed online survey about the draft themes of Glasgow's initial resilience plans. The survey was designed to interrogate the themes and to generate opportunities for new thinking which could be incorporated into the next phase of work.\n",

The ability for community groups to participate in conversations about how budgets are allocated and resources managed is one that requires us to re-examine existing ways of working. Through the Glasgow Community Planning Partnership, and in line with our aspiration to facilitate the growth of cooperative businesses and social enterprises, we are reflecting on the relationships we must develop in order to build skills and confidence within our communities. The Community Empowerment Act (Scotland) 2015 provides further opportunities for community groups to influence how spaces and assets are programmed for public use.

       "\"Glasgow's first resilience strategy, presented by the city leader, aims to enhance the city's ability to adapt and thrive amid future challenges, building on its historical strengths and community spirit. The strategy emphasizes tackling inequalities and prioritizing the needs of disadvantaged communities, informed by extensive engagement with over 3,500 residents. It outlines a roadmap for resilience through four strategic pillars: empowering Glaswegians, unlocking place-based solutions, innovating for fair economic growth, and fostering civic participation, with specific goals and actions to be implemented over the next two years. The strategy integrates existing city initiatives and aims to create a fairer, more just Glasgow, while also addressing chronic stresses such as poverty and inequality. The city’s membership in the 100 Resilient Cities network further supports its commitment to resilience, with ongoing collaboration among various stakeholders to ensure effective implementation and continuous improvement.\""
